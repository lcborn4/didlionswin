# AWS Deployment Options for didlionswin (Next.js)

## Cost Analysis for Different AWS Deployment Strategies

### ðŸ¥‡ **Option 1: Static Export to S3 + CloudFront (CHEAPEST)**
**Estimated Monthly Cost: $1-5**

**Pros:**
- Extremely low cost (S3 storage ~$0.02/GB, CloudFront ~$0.085/GB)
- Lightning fast performance (CDN)
- No cold starts
- Scales infinitely
- Simple deployment

**Cons:**
- Need to convert SSR to Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Data updates require rebuild/redeploy
- No server-side logic at request time

**Best for:** didlionswin because:
- Sports data doesn't change frequently
- Can rebuild daily or when games happen
- Simple content structure

---

### ðŸ¥ˆ **Option 2: Serverless (Lambda + API Gateway) Like Sporterie**
**Estimated Monthly Cost: $5-20**

**Pros:**
- Pay only for execution time
- Supports SSR and API routes
- Similar to your sporterie setup
- Auto-scaling

**Cons:**
- Cold starts (1-3 second delays)
- More complex setup
- Higher cost than static
- Lambda timeout limits (15 min max)

**Best for:** Apps needing real-time data or user interactions

---

### ðŸ¥‰ **Option 3: AWS Amplify**
**Estimated Monthly Cost: $15-50+**

**Pros:**
- Easy deployment
- Built-in CI/CD
- Supports SSR out of the box
- Custom domains included

**Cons:**
- Most expensive option
- Less control over infrastructure
- Can have unexpected cost spikes

**Best for:** Enterprise apps or when development speed > cost

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation for didlionswin: Static Export (Option 1)**

Your app is perfect for static generation because:

1. **Sports data is predictable** - Games happen on schedule
2. **Content doesn't change frequently** - Results update after games
3. **Simple user interaction** - Just viewing data, no user accounts
4. **Performance matters** - Sports fans want instant results

### Implementation Strategy:

1. **Convert to Static Generation:**
   ```javascript
   // In next.config.js
   const nextConfig = {
     output: 'export',
     images: { unoptimized: true },
     trailingSlash: true,
   }
   ```

2. **Data Fetching Strategy:**
   - Use `generateStaticParams` for static generation
   - Pre-build pages for current season
   - Rebuild on schedule (daily or after games)

3. **Deployment Pipeline:**
   - GitHub Actions builds static files
   - Upload to S3
   - Invalidate CloudFront cache
   - Cost: ~$2/month for typical traffic

### Migration Path:

**Phase 1:** Convert current SSR to ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
**Phase 2:** Add scheduled rebuilds via GitHub Actions
**Phase 3:** Full static export with automated deployments

## Cost Breakdown Example (1000 visitors/month):

| Service | Static S3+CF | Serverless | Amplify |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------|
| S3 Storage | $0.02 | $0.02 | Included |
| CloudFront | $0.85 | $0.85 | Included |
| Lambda | $0 | $5-10 | Included |
| API Gateway | $0 | $3-5 | Included |
| Amplify Hosting | $0 | $0 | $15+ |
| **Total** | **$0.87** | **$8-15** | **$15+** |

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Test static export** locally
2. **Set up S3 + CloudFront** infrastructure
3. **Create deployment pipeline**
4. **Monitor costs** and performance

The static approach will save you **90%+ on hosting costs** while providing better performance than SSR options.
